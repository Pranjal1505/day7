 Learn to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions.

# Steps 
1. Opened Chrome extension manager using 'chrome://extensions'.

3. Analyzed the following:

  - Action: Kept

# Potentially Suspicious:
- McAfee WebAdvisor
  - Source: Added by third-party
  - Permissions: Access to browsing history, download management
  - Action: Removed to avoid unnecessary tracking and high permissions

# Outcome
